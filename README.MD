<h1>Link Shortener MiniProject</h1>

The goal of this project is to make a site that shortens links. I will use a database to keep track of the URLs linked to any specific site.

I will most likely deploy this in the future, for my own personal use.

Decided to use Node, Express, MySQL, and EJS as a templating engine.

Made these two of designs for mobile and desktop.
